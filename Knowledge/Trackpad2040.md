This looks like a great start:

The paper: [[MTK_Multitouch_DIY.pdf]]
The tutorial: [[MTK_Tutorial.pdf]]

Arduino-based, can take trash electrodes, why the fuck not...

So let's reproduce it on something a bit beefier, hoping we can achieve higher poll rate and thus less latency! Besides, if we have a beefy MC to run this off, we can do all kinds of cool shit with it!
