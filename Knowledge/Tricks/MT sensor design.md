https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxLzgeiJQbE - projected touch basics, explained as RX catching reflected from TX signal
- crucial moment is the coupling of the human to the ground plane - better sensitivity when this coupling is great. So, ground pour...
- gap between diamonds is recommended to be x0.6 of the overlay thickness. HMMM.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokWXzVXsyc - sensing through metal
- works by metal plate deflecting, essentially the metal transfers the displacement down to lines. Cool, but forceful, and won't allow for fine-grained detection? The TI's IC detects deflections on micron level.. HMMM... Maybe. Maybe there's something in here... But in this case I can't let silicone to be the carrier, overall seems like too much trouble. Unless we're doing a sludge of glass beads that the user can push around/through?..
